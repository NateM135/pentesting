# Port 22 \(SSH\)

### General Notes

* If you get a potential username/password, you can SSH with them like this:`ssh user@ip`. You will be prompted for the password.
* If you get a private key from somewhere, you need to change permissions before using it to SSH.

```bash
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa user@ip
```

* If you only get a username, you can try to bruteforce with Hydra.

### Bruteforce

* Bruteforcing can easily be donedone with hydra. 

```bash
hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> -vV <ip> ssh
hydra -L <userlist> -P <wordlist> -vV <ip> ssh
```
